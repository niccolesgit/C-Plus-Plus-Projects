HASH FUNCTION DESCRIPTION
I based a lot of my hash function based off the one we used in Lab 11, modifying to fit 
the correct objects I was using for this homework. The hash function itself I found online
browsing hash functions on http://www.partow.net/programming/hashfunctions/ and I selected
the SDMB function because they described it on the website as very useful when operating
over various different data sets and works well with high variences (so the top 250 example 
would be able to work well). Upon later research on why this was the best one, 
SDBM was used for databases in libraries. Libraries have their own system of matching IDs to books
so I thought the homework was doing something similar, so that's why I chose to use this hash function.
